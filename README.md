# LegalKit Platform (Public Redacted)

This repository is a **public, redacted mirror** of the private `legalkit-platform` repo.

Goals:
- Preserve commit history (authors/timestamps/messages)
- Remove proprietary source code and implementation details
- Publish demo screenshots/videos

## Demo
See [`demo/`](demo/).

## Proofs Archive
Historical UI proof screenshots live under [`docs/proofs/`](docs/proofs/).

## What's Redacted
Nearly all non-demo content has been removed from history to avoid leaking private code.
