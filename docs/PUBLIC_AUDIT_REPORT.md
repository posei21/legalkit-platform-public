# LegalKit Public Audit Report

Updated: 2026-02-15

This is the public-facing product audit for LegalKit. It reflects what is demonstrably visible in this public repository and demo artifacts.

## Scope

- Public demo repo: `/Users/jorgie/Desktop/legalkit-platform-public`
- Demo walkthrough: `/Users/jorgie/Desktop/legalkit-platform-public/demo/README.md`
- Proof assets: `/Users/jorgie/Desktop/legalkit-platform-public/docs/proofs/2025-12-16/ui/`

## Evidence Standard

- High confidence: visible UI flows and screenshots in this repo.
- Medium confidence: claims stated in public docs but not shown in code here.
- Out of scope: private source implementation details.

## Validated Capabilities (Public Evidence)

1. Website scan kickoff flow is shown.
2. Compliance gap review is shown.
3. Policy generation and deploy flow is shown.
4. Live consent banner behavior is shown.
5. Live hosted policy routes are shown.

## Proof Artifacts

- `/Users/jorgie/Desktop/legalkit-platform-public/demo/demo.gif`

## Public Positioning Guardrails

- Present these capabilities as demo-validated outcomes.
- Avoid claims that require private runtime evidence unless separately published.
- Keep language specific: "shown in demo" instead of "fully automated across all environments."

## Known Gaps In This Public Repo

- Private source code is intentionally excluded.
- No public test logs or backend runtime traces are included here.
- Enterprise-grade claims should be paired with additional public proof artifacts if needed for sales or diligence.

## Next Suggested Refinements

1. Add timestamped run logs for one end-to-end public flow.
2. Add a short changelog section for report updates.
3. Add a one-page buyer summary with feature, proof link, and confidence.
